## How to report a bug

If you came across a bug, we highly encourage that you report it here so we can take a look and fix it.

Before reporting a bug, we highly recommend that you read [Before you submit a bug report](#before-you-submit-a-bug-report) and [How to write a good bug report](#how-to-write-a-good-bug-report) first.

### Before you submit a bug report

Before submitting a bug report, there are a few things you need to take in consideration:

* Do a bit of research and check if a similar bug has already been reported.
  * If it has been reported already, add a comment to the existing one if you have anything to add to it.

### How to write a good bug report

We have a few short tips on how to write a good bug report so the developers can have an easy time jumping on it:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue.**
* **Describe the steps to reproduce the bug.**
* **Describe what behaviour you observed after the bug occured.**
* **Explain what behaviour you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before it happened.**
* **Include screnshots of the bug.**
* **Write what version of Bliss OS you were using.**

And most important of all, make sure to fulfill as many as fields you can in our bug report template.

The more information you give us, and the more accurate it is, the sooner we'll have a fix for the bug.
